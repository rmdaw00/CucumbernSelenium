feature files -> Step definition file -> runner files

Example Mapping:
is Mapping user story with several examples that lead to identification of business rules
User Story -> Example -> Business Rules

this will result in "feature files"

Feature files
written in Gherkin Domain specific language Gherkin DSL
Feature: Menu Management
  Scenario: Add a menu item
    Given   …    #condition
    When    …    #action
    Then    …    #result

you will notice that step definition file that variables in feature files are converted into parameters of the methods
these variables are called cucumber variables

whenever running a definition file and it encounters a pending exception, it stops running that entire files

the @CucumberOptions is depreciated so if you want to use cucumber with JUnit5 use
  @Suite
  @SelectClasspathResource("com/rmdaw/cucumber/features")
  //@ConfigurationParameter(key = GLUE_PROPERTY_NAME, value = "com.rmdaw.cucumber")
  //@ConfigurationParameter(key = PLUGIN_PROPERTY_NAME, value = "pretty")

you can save the configurations in junit-platform.properties
  cucumber.publish.quiet=true
  cucumber.plugin=pretty,...
  cucumber.glue=com.rmdaw.cucumber,...
